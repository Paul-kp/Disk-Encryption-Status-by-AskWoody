# Disk-Encryption-Status-by-AskWoody
Test the encryption status of your Windows 10 / 11 disks

New Windows machines will likely have disk encryption turned on by default. Unfortunately, you, the user, are not notified if your disk is encrypted.
This simple PowerShell script and its accompanying Windows Command script allow you to quickly check the encryption status and gives you advice regarding any action you may need to take to store or access the BitLocker recovery key.

## Use
1. Download the ZIP file.
2. Extract both files (CMD and PS1) to a new folder.
3. Double click on the Windows Command Script (CMD) file.
4. Windows SmartScreen will pop up a warning about the unknown script. Click on “More Info” and then “Run anyway”.
