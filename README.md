# Disk-Encryption-Status-by-AskWoody
Test the encryption status of your Windows 10 / 11 disks

New Windows machines will likely have disk encryption turned on by default. Unfortunately, you, the user, are not notified if your disk is encrypted.
This simple PowerShell script and its accompanying Batch file allow you to quickly check the encryption status and gives you advice regarding any action you may need to take to store / access the BitLocker recovery key.
